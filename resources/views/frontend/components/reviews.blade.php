                         "“A Brief History of a Perfect Future” presents us with a rare
                         gift in this era of pervasive negativity, anonymous grousing,
                         and divisiveness. It offers a positive and optimistic view of
                         our future, grounded in facts and the lessons of history. It is
                         both inspirational and aspirational on how we can be proactive
                         to make this vision a reality. Highly recommended! Reading it
                         should put a spring in your step and a smile on your face!”"
